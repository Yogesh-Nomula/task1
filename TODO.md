# Bike Racing Game Development Plan

## Phase 1: Project Setup
- [ ] Set up project structure (assets/, js/, levels/)
- [ ] Include Three.js and physics library (Cannon.js) via CDN
- [ ] Create basic HTML structure with canvas and UI elements
- [ ] Set up basic CSS for mobile optimization

## Phase 2: Core 3D Scene and Bike
- [ ] Initialize Three.js scene, camera, renderer
- [ ] Create basic bike model (using Three.js geometries or load 3D model)
- [ ] Implement basic bike physics (movement, gravity)
- [ ] Add camera following the bike

## Phase 3: Controls and Physics
- [ ] Implement tilt controls using device orientation API
- [ ] Add button controls for acceleration/brake (touch-friendly)
- [ ] Refine bike physics (wheel friction, suspension, etc.)
- [ ] Add collision detection with ground and obstacles

## Phase 4: Track and Environment
- [ ] Create first track with basic geometry (road, barriers)
- [ ] Add obstacles, ramps, and stunt elements
- [ ] Implement track boundaries and checkpoints
- [ ] Add environmental elements (trees, buildings, skybox)

## Phase 5: Game Mechanics
- [ ] Add coins and collectibles system
- [ ] Implement speed boosters
- [ ] Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- [ ] Add unlockable bikes with different stats

## Phase 6: Audio and Effects
- [ ] Add background music
- [ ] Implement sound effects for bike engine, collisions, etc.
- [ ] Add particle effects for boosts, crashes

## Phase 7: UI and Leaderboard
- [ ] Create game UI (speedometer, score, level indicator)
- [ ] Implement pause menu and level selection
- [ ] Add leaderboard system using local storage
- [ ] Create main menu with bike selection

## Phase 8: Optimization and Mobile
- [ ] Optimize for mobile performance (LOD, texture compression)
- [ ] Test and fix touch controls
- [ ] Add Cordova/PhoneGap wrapper for Android/iOS
- [ ] Final testing on actual devices

## Phase 9: Polish and Extras
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Implement save/load game progress
- [ ] Add social features (share scores)
- [ ] Final bug fixes and performance tweaks
